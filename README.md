# Fitness and Health Tracking Program
This is a python program designed to read in my lifting data and create graphs for me to visualize my progress at the gym

## Ideas for new features
- [ ] Prompt the user what feature of the app they want to use (plot data, plot measurement, run report)
- [ ] Read in measurement data and make trend line graphs
- [ ] When data changes tell the user what has changed since last time
- [ ] When a trend-line graph is made write a report that says if it is trending up or down
- [ ] Plot data for body weight exercises
- [ ] Somehow differentiate if straps were used or not
- [ ] Group lifts into legs/arms or upper lower (or allow multiple groupings). IE tag a lift
- [ ] Report on the max weight, max vol, and most recent weight of each type of lift
