# Fitness and Health Tracking Program
This is a python program designed to read in my lifting data and create graphs for me to visualize my progress at the gym

## Ideas for new features
    - [ ]  Prompt the user what feature of the app they want to use (plot data, plot measurement, run report)
    - [ ] \(Optional) read in measurement data and make trend line graphs
    - [ ] \(Optional) when tell the user what has changed since last time
    - [ ] \(Optional) when a trend-line graph is made write a report that says if it is trending up or down
    - [ ] \(Optional) plot data for body weight exercises
    - [ ] \(Optional) somehow differentiate if straps were used or not
    - [ ] \(Optional) group lifts into legs/arms or upper lower (or allow multiple groupings). IE tag a lift
    - [ ] \(Optional) Report on the max weight, max vol, and most recent weight of each type of lift
