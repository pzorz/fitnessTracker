#Fintess and Health Tracking Program (FHTP)
This is a python program designed to read in my lifting data and create graphs for me to visualize my progress at the gym

##Ideas for new features
    IDEA: Prompt the user what feature of the app they want to use (plot data, plot measurement, run report)
    IDEA: read in measurement data and make trend line graphs
    IDEA: when tell the user what has changed since last time
    IDEA: when a trend-line graph is made write a report that says if it is trending up or down
    IDEA: plot data for body weight exercises
    IDEA: somehow differentiate if straps were used or not
    IDEA: group lifts into legs/arms or upper lower (or allow multiple groupings). IE tag a lift
    IDEA: Report on the max weight, max vol, and most recent weight of each type of lift
